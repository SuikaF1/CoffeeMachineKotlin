# CoffeeMachineKotlin
This program simulates a coffee machine with a certain amount of available resouces. 
The user interacts with the machine in a form of using a console. The console function
in the CoffeeMachine class will control the flow of interaction with the machine.
The main fucntion has a never ending while loop that ends only when the user types
"exit" and then the program ends.

My ultimate goal with this small project was getting familliar with a couple of concepts
such as, encapsulation, control flow, const variables, commenting a project, and a little
bit of string manipulation.

This project idea was from hyperskill.org. All steps were completed through their guide.
Although they guide you through the creation of the program all of the code was made by me
they give you the outcome and the goal is to make code with the outcome. Thanks for taking
a look.
